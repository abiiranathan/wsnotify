Excellent question. This is a classic and subtle problem that perfectly illustrates why time-based, non-deterministic tests often fail in different environments like GitHub CI.

The Root Cause: A Race Condition

Your test fails in CI because it relies on a race condition that you happen to win on your local machine but lose on the slower, more resource-constrained CI runner.

Here's the sequence of events and the race:

Your Test Goroutine: It's in a tight for loop, calling server.Publish(). This tries to push a message onto the client's send channel (chan []byte).

The Client's writePump Goroutine: This separate goroutine is running in the background. Its job is to pull messages from that same send channel and write them to the underlying network connection.

The Race:
For your backpressure logic to trigger, your test goroutine must fill the send channel (size 2) and attempt to send a 3rd message before the writePump goroutine has a chance to pull even a single message out.

Locally: Your machine is likely fast. The Go scheduler lets your test's for loop run uninterrupted for long enough to spam 3+ messages into the channel before the writePump even gets scheduled. The buffer fills, backpressure triggers, and the test passes.

In GitHub CI: The runners are often virtualized and have less consistent performance. The Go scheduler might be more aggressive about context switching. It's highly likely that the following happens:

Test Goroutine sends message 0. send channel has 1 item.

Scheduler switches to writePump. It pulls message 0 and starts writing it to the network. send channel has 0 items.

Scheduler switches back to the Test Goroutine. It sends message 1. send channel has 1 item.

Scheduler switches to writePump... and so on.

Because the writePump is successfully draining the channel, the channel never becomes full, the default case in your enqueueOrDrop function is never hit, and the backpressure mechanism never kicks in.

The Solution: Deterministic Blocking

The fix is to eliminate the race condition by removing the reliance on time.Sleep and the scheduler's whims. We need to deterministically block the writePump so we can guarantee the send channel will fill up.

We can achieve this by creating a custom net.Conn implementation that allows us to pause its Write method on command. This will cause the writePump to block exactly when we want it to.

Here is the corrected, deterministic test. I've added extensive comments to explain each part of the new setup.

Step 1: Create a Controllable net.Conn

First, let's define a helper struct that wraps a net.Conn and lets us block its Write operation.

```go
// blockingConn is a net.Conn wrapper that allows us to deterministically
// block the Write method, simulating a slow network connection.
type blockingConn struct {
	net.Conn
	blockWrites chan struct{} // Blocks until this channel is closed
}

func newBlockingConn(conn net.Conn) *blockingConn {
	return &blockingConn{
		Conn:        conn,
		blockWrites: make(chan struct{}),
	}
}

// Write blocks until unblock() is called, then proceeds with the underlying write.
func (bc *blockingConn) Write(b []byte) (int, error) {
	<-bc.blockWrites
	return bc.Conn.Write(b)
}

// unblock allows any blocked Write calls to proceed.
func (bc *blockingConn) unblock() {
	close(bc.blockWrites)
}
```

Step 2: Write the Deterministic Test

Now, we'll use this blockingConn to write a test that is not subject to scheduling races. This test uses net.Pipe() to create an in-memory connection, giving us full control.

```go
// Add this helper to your test file if it's not already there.
// It's used to wait for a condition to be true, polling with a timeout.
func waitFor(t *testing.T, condition func() bool, msg string) {
	t.Helper()
	deadline := time.Now().Add(2 * time.Second)
	for time.Now().Before(deadline) {
		if condition() {
			return
		}
		time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond)
	}
	t.Fatal(msg)
}


func TestBackpressureHandling_Deterministic(t *testing.T) {
	// 1. Create a server with a very small buffer and backpressure enabled.
	opts := ServerOptions{
		SendBuffer:         2, // Buffer size of 2
		DropOnBackpressure: true,
		BackpressureReason: "test backpressure",
	}
	opts.Defaults()
	server := NewServer(opts)
	defer server.Shutdown(context.Background())

	// 2. Create an in-memory network connection using net.Pipe().
	// This gives us two ends of a connection without real networking.
	serverConn, clientConn := net.Pipe()

	// 3. Wrap the server's end of the connection with our blockingConn.
	// The writePump will use this connection. We will NOT unblock it initially,
	// forcing the writePump to hang on its first attempt to write.
	blockableServerConn := newBlockingConn(serverConn)
	defer blockableServerConn.unblock() // Ensure it's unblocked on test exit

	// 4. Manually create the server-side websocket and wsnotify client.
	// This simulates a client connecting and being registered.
	wsServerConn := websocket.NewServerConn(blockableServerConn, true)
	client := server.newClient(wsServerConn)
	go client.serve() // Start the client's read/write pumps

	// 5. Subscribe the client to a channel.
	channel := Channel("backpressure-channel")
	if err := server.Subscribe(client, channel); err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("failed to subscribe: %v", err)
	}

	// Sanity check: ensure the client is connected before we proceed.
	if server.GetConnectedClients() != 1 {
		t.Fatalf("Expected 1 client to be connected, got %d", server.GetConnectedClients())
	}

	// 6. Spam the publish method.
	// The client's writePump is blocked, so its `send` channel is guaranteed to fill.
	// Message 1: Fills slot 1/2 in the buffer.
	// Message 2: Fills slot 2/2 in the buffer.
	// Message 3: The buffer is full. This call will trigger the backpressure logic.
	for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
		// We don't need to check the error here, as the backpressure logic
		// is designed to return an error, which is what we are testing.
		_ = server.Publish(channel, fmt.Sprintf("message %d", i))
	}

	// 7. Wait for the client to be disconnected.
	// Instead of an unreliable time.Sleep, we poll until the condition is met.
	waitFor(t, func() bool {
		return server.GetConnectedClients() == 0
	}, "Timed out waiting for client to be disconnected")


	// 8. Verify the connection is actually closed from the client's perspective.
	// We use the other end of the pipe (`clientConn`) to simulate the test client.
	wsClientConn, _, err := websocket.NewClient(clientConn, "ws://localhost/ws", nil, 1024, 1024)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("Failed to create websocket client from pipe: %v", err)
	}
	defer wsClientConn.Close()

	_, _, err = wsClientConn.ReadMessage()
	if err == nil {
		t.Error("Expected connection to be closed due to backpressure, but ReadMessage succeeded")
	} else {
		// Check for the specific close error.
		closeErr, ok := err.(*websocket.CloseError)
		if !ok || closeErr.Code != websocket.CloseGoingAway {
			t.Errorf("Expected a websocket.CloseError with code CloseGoingAway, but got: %T %v", err, err)
		}
	}
}
